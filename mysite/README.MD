The intention of this project is to create a website where people can create their own customized fantasy leagues.  This is intended to be flexible enough to include things like:
- The Oscars
- Fantasy Bachelor
- Elections
- Sports
- Etc., etc.

Another way of conceiving this as a generalized platform for fantasy games(/quasi-betting) on different sorts of events in the world.  It should be built in a way that allows small leagues for groups of friends, or large leagues to allow people to compete with celebrities/influencers/etc.

Structurally, what are the things that need to exist?
- Users
- Leagues
	- Rules
- Point Sets
- Decision Frameworks

What are some of the pages that need to exist?
- Home page
- User page
- League page
- Sign up

What are other things I need to worry about?
- Mobile Capacity
- Databases
- Advertising/Outreach/Figuring Things Out (Yikes)
